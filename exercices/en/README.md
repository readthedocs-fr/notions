# Exercises

This section is devoted to **exercises**. They are arranged by language so that they can be easily found. If you can't find an exercise in a certain language but 
you think it is feasible, feel free to contribute: wink:

The **corrections** are given with explanations when necessary.
But remember one thing, there is never only one possible solution!

Do not hesitate to propose your own exercises and corrections by contributing to the repository via the `fork` and` Pull Request` systems.
