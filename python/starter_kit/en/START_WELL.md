# Starting Off Right with Python

Programming is a very interesting, lucrative and vast domain.
Choosing Python as a first language is really often a judicious choice for many reasons.

Here are some of them:
- Python has a very simple syntax, that permits to get compact and readable codes ;
- Python is very rich. Concretely, we can do a huge amount of things with it.
From AI, to the Web backend, to its usage in scientific domains... the list goes on ;
- The language has a huge community of developers with a lot of resources,
 and some of its functionalities make the learning process easier for beginners.
One example is that the language does not enforce the usage of `;` after each instruction.


### Some Good Resources to get started

In fact, the resources available on the Internet are not always relevant or up-to-date.
As a solution to solve this issue, [learndev.info](https://www.learndev.info/en) was created, aiming to offer adapted and relevant courses,
such as the course of **[ TODO ]**.



### Mistakes Not to Do When You Begin

Many people begin programming with the idea that it is not necessarily complicated,
thinking they can quickly start very big projects without the need to acquire the basics.
Well, that is mostly a big mistake.

In fact, when it comes to learning a language (whether it is Python or another), things need to be done carefully.
You should not try to drive a car before learning to do it. And yet, unfortunately a lot of
Python beginners get to work with libraries that are way too complicated for them, like
`Pygame`, `Tkinter` or `discord.py` and whose usage require notions such as the 
Object Oriented Programming, error handling, decorators or even manipulation of threads/async.

If you do not know what a function or an object is, or can not manipulate `for` and `while` loops,
you had better put your project aside for a time to consolidate your knowledge and even, make
projects at your scale in order to accumulate knowledge for the one that is close to your heart.
Do not be afraid to let aside a project for several months.
Accumulating frustration by continuously failing on a too ambitious project can disgust you 
with programming in general (that would be counterproductive).


### Projects, lots of projects, more projects!

Nothing beats starting programming by giving yourself objectives. Having a project
is a great way to learn. After seeing the theory in courses,
beginning a project allows you to practice. Practicing is the only way that permits to remember in the long run.
Therefore, you should definitely find projects adapted to what you are currently learning.

Here are some examples:
- A fair price game after seeing loops and conditions ;
- A hangman, when you master the treatment of character strings ;
- A tic-tac-toe in shell, pretty fun and instructive to assimilate the loops.

Once the basis mastered, do not hesitate to be curious. Relying on your knowledge only does not permit you to improve.
There are always things to learn, to experiment or to discover.

### Conclusion

Python is a really good language if you are a rookie in the programming world. Not only it is easy to learn,
but also it allows you to do a huge amount of things. Despite the fact that it is necessary to practice by workinng on projects,
it is very discouraged to begin with something too big for yourself.
Finally, if there were only one sentence to remember from all this, it would be this one: "Never stop learning".
